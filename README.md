# Pong1.0 from scratch
 My first attempt at making a game from scratch. Used openGL for rendering and used an ECS architecture

I always wanted to try to make game engine components, and after the newest Unity scandal I was inspired to give a try at my own engine.

Its not perfect, it doesnt have some features of a regular game, and the collisions could bug out but as I create new games, add more to the engine, and refine parts of the engine, I will try to come back to this and update it

To craft the ECS system I used the following as a reference: https://code.austinmorlan.com/austin/2019-ecs
Additionally I used the following to softly guide how to code through the Pong game: https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout

If you want to the game for yourself you just need the GAME EXE folder :)
